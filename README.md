![alt text](https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/1537294.png)

Welcome to my ALX Low-Level Programming Tasks Repository!

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on low-level programming tasks in the C language. These projects cover a wide range of topics, from fundamental concepts like variables, loops, and conditional statements to more advanced areas such as data structures, memory management, and file manipulation.
Each project directory represents a specific topic and includes a set of related tasks and code examples. These tasks are designed to enhance yomy  understanding of low-level programming and sharpen my skills in writing efficient and optimized code.
Explore the different project directories to delve into various aspects of the C language and low-level programming principles. Each directory is accompanied by a detailed README file, providing explanations, instructions, and code samples for the tasks within.



<b>Directory</b>                 |     <b>Brief Summary</b>
-------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------
C Hello World                    |   The classic "Hello, World!" program in the C language. This simple program serves as an introductory example, demonstrating how to print text to the console.
C If/Else/While                     If-else statements allow you to make decisions in your code based on conditions. While loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true. This topic covers how to use if-else statements and while loops in C.
