C Pointers,Arrays And Strings |  Pointers are variables that store memory addresses, allowing for more efficient memory management in C. This topic covers how to declare, initialize, and use pointers. It also covers arrays, which are collections of elements of the same type, and strings, which are arrays of characters in C.
C More Pointers,Arrays And Strings |   This topic builds on the previous one, going into more detail on pointers, arrays, and strings. It covers topics such as pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, multidimensional arrays, and string manipulation.
C Recursion                        |  Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. This topic explores the concept of recursion in C and how it can be used to solve certain problems more elegantly.
C Static Libraries                 | Static libraries are collections of precompiled object files that can be linked with your program at compile time. This topic covers creating and using static libraries in C, enabling code reuse and modular development.
C argc, argv                       | The argc and argv parameters allow you to pass command-line arguments to a C program. This topic covers how to use these parameters to process input from the command line when running your C program.
C Malloc And Free                  |  Dynamic memory allocation is a technique for allocating memory on the heap at runtime. This topic explores the use of malloc and free functions in C for dynamically allocating and releasing memory.
C More Malloc And Free             | The "C More Malloc and Free" project directory builds upon the previous section on memory management. This section delves deeper into dynamic memory allocation using the malloc and free functions in C. You will explore dynamic memory allocation for multi-dimensional arrays, linked data structures, and more advanced memory management techniques. The tasks and examples in this section will enhance your understanding of efficient memory utilization and deallocation in C programs.
C Preprocessor                     | The "C Preprocessing and Compilation" project directory focuses on the preprocessing and compilation phases of the C code execution process. The C preprocessor modifies the source code before compilation, allowing for conditional compilation, macro expansion, and header file inclusion. This section covers preprocessor directives, macros, conditional compilation, header file inclusion, and other preprocessor features in C. Additionally, this project directory delves into the compilation process itself, including the translation of C code into object code and the linking of object files to create an executable program. You will learn about compiler options, object files, the linker, and the connection between different compilation units.
C Structs                          | The "C Structs" project directory explores the powerful concept of structs in C. Structs allow you to define custom data types that can hold different data types together in a single entity. By organizing related data under a single structure, you can create more complex data structures and improve code organization. This section covers struct declaration, initialization, accessing struct members, and utilizing structs for various purposes like data organization, representing entities, and more.
C Function Pointers                | The "C Function Pointers" project directory introduces the concept of function pointers in C. Function pointers allow for dynamic execution of functions, enabling powerful programming techniques like callbacks, polymorphism, and dynamic dispatch. This section covers the declaration, initialization, and use of function pointers in various scenarios. Through examples and tasks, you will learn how to leverage function pointers to achieve more flexible and extensible code structures.
C Variadic Functions               | The "C Variadic Functions" project directory focuses on variadic functions in C, which accept a varying number of arguments. Variadic functions are commonly used in libraries and frameworks for printf-like formatting, handling variable-length argument lists, and implementing generic functions. By exploring the tasks and examples in this section, you will gain a solid understanding of how to define and use variadic functions effectively in your C programs.
C Singly Linked List               |   A linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes linked together. This topic focuses on singly linked lists, covering how to create, manipulate, and traverse these data structures in C.

C Doubly Linked List               |     A doubly linked list is an extension of a linked list where each node has both forward and backward pointers. This topic explores the implementation and operations on doubly linked lists in C.
C Dynamic Libraries                | Dynamic libraries (shared libraries) are compiled code modules that can be loaded and linked with a program at run time. This topic covers creating and using dynamic libraries in C, promoting modularity and code reuse.


##Basic Requirements For Most Project Directories

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called function_pointers.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
*  Directories at the beginning did not use printf as it was not allowed.
